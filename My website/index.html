    <h4>The way she does stuff is great and it helps the people that need it.</h4>
    <h3>The Plan</h3>
    <p>When you get to class She lets you settle in, then she gives you a styleis to use on your ipad, she then shows you what to do to get you started, and in her grade 9 french class you have to just follow along and answer questions, and at like 10:00AM she takes you for a walk if we still have the 2 hours and 30 min classes when you read this, and when you get back we sometimes did kahoots and games, and on the first few days its easy and so fun,</p>
